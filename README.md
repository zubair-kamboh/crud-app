This is a mini CRUD application App with all crud functionalities like Create, Read, Update, Delete.
1- build with reactjs
2- using json server (fake api server) to store data, which will not work directly when you clone this repository. So you are required to start the json server first.
3- using firebase hosting to deploy this app (https://crud-app-20b36.web.app/).
